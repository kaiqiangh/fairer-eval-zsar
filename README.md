# Fairer Evaluation of Zero Shot Action Recognition in Videos

The revised human action datasets (UCF101 and HMDB51) are published in this repo. They can be used to evaluate the task of zero-shot action recognition in a fair way.

The Excel file has four sheets and each sheet is related to one overlapping case between ZSL dataset and pre-training dataset (see more details in th paper). The overlapping classes for UCF101 and HMDB51 are hightlighted in red, andnon-overlapping classes are in black. Pepole can directly use them for ZSAR evaluation in a fair way.
